title: Learning blunt to fakie

<p>
  Recently I landed my first blunt to fakie.
  So I shared my thoughts about it in a video.

<p>
  Since I made the video, I did a blunt to fakie on a 4-foot ramp.
  Also I landed some switch blunts.
  Below I have a summary of the video and also some updated thoughts on these tricks.
</p>
<h3>Blunt nose grab</h3>
<p>
  One of the biggest hurdles with blunts is keping your feet on the board.
  Blunt nose grab to fakie is a great way to give yourself the confidence to keep both feet on the board.
</p>
<h3>Small ramps</h3>
<p>
  A smaller ramp <em>can</em> make this more difficult.
  But having a shorter height to fall makes it less scary.
</p>
<h3>Wear pads</h3>
<p>
  Injuries aren't fun.
  If it helps you with the process, I say wear all the pads you can.
  I put on my hockey gear to help with the fear.
</p>
<h3>Ollie to fakie</h3>
<p>
  You get back in the ramp by doing an ollie to fakie.
  At first I was pinning the board to the ramp and jumping away from the ramp.
  You might need to learn the rhythym of doing an ollie back into the ramp.
</p>
<h3>Landing in the ramp</h3>
<p>
  For some reason when I visualize this trick, I picture myself being parallel to the ground, and needing to think about orienting myself on the ramp.
  But in my experience the landing happens very naturally without much thought.
</p>
<h3>Find a mantra</h3>
<p>
  With switch blunts I had to get over the fear of ollie-ing into the ramp again.
  I learned that repeating a mantra can help.
  I started thinking "It's just an ollie."
  That helped me commit to keeping my feet on the board.
</p>
<h3>Where I'm at now</h3>
<p>
  I did my first blunt to fakie 3 months ago today.
  Since then I've done them on larger ramps and also I've done a few switch blunts.
  However, my confidence is currently shaken.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>In November I had a rib injury while trying switch blunt nose grabs.</li>
  <li>On Christmas I think I experienced whiplash after hanging up on a switch blunt.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  My plan to get back into blunts is to take a step back, and get more comfortable with blunt nose grabs.
  Once I feel comfortable with those, I'll start working on the ollie version of the trick again.
  This approach is partly inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh0YaEjs3oo">SquareState Skate</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Regardless of the injuries, I'm still proud that I landed this trick.
  When I started skateboarding back in 2022, I never imagined that I'd do a blunt to fakie.
  Heck, I never imagined I'd do most of the tricks that I've learned so far.
