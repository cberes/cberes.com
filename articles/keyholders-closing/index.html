    <h2>Keyholders skatepark closing soon</h2>
    <p id="time">2024/02/15</p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately it appears my <a href="../skatepark-tier-list/">scathing review</a> of Keyholders was their death sentence. I read on Instagram that they'll be closing in early spring.
    </p>
    <p id="summary">
        While I didn't like Keyholders, I'm sorry to see that it's closing. In my opinion,
        more skateparks means fewer people at my skatepark. Also I assume having more skateparks helps grow the sport locally. I don't know how many beginner skaters Keyholders attracted, but it can't hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another reason I'm sad to see it go: Keyholders has the only vert ramp in the Buffalo area.
        I don't skate vert, but I know some people do.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, the vert ramp might be part of their problem.
        First, I imagine that vert is not very popular.
        Second, the vert ramp
        takes up half of Keyholders. Imagine if more of their space was devoted to street skating. It could be one of the best parks in the area. 
    </p>

        I'm not too shocked to see this news.
        Food Court's opening must have hurt Keyholders, and in my opinion Food Court
        is markedly superior.
        Last year I decided that I wouldn't go to Keyholders during its "public hours."
        The street section was small, and it took only a few skaters for the park to feel busy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Public hours are another problem. During the week, the park doesn't open to non-subscribers until 5 pm. Even on the weekend the park is closed to non-subscribers until 2 or 3 pm. On the other hand, Food Court is open from noon to 4 and 5 to 9 every day.

        I remember reading in the <a href="https://www.buffalorising.com/2022/12/buffalo-keyholders-skatepark/">Buffalo Rising article</a>
        about Keyholders that the article's author called for "more indoor activities for people to participate in during the wintertime."
        I hadn't thought about it before, but it's true that snowy-winter towns should provide more indoor activities for their residents. In an area where it's cold and snowy for four to five months out of the year, more money should be put into indoor activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keyholders is the only skatepark in Lackawanna.
        That will leave three skateparks in the southtowns: Food Court, Orchard Park, and Hamburg; the latter two are arguably unusable.
    </p>
    <p>
        If it's not too late, I'd like to see if Lackawanna could do something to keep Keyholders open. Maybe they pay some of the bills in exchange for free or discounted admission for Lackawanna residents. If anything, we need more indoor activities, not less.
