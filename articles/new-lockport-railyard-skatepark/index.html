    <h2>New Lockport Railyard Skatepark</h2>
    <p id="time">2024/04/28</p>
    <p>
        This past Friday I visited Lockport's new Railyard skatepark for the first time.
        The concrete skatepark replaced the wooden skatepark that was torn down last year.
    </p>
    <p>
        I won't include any pictures here, but I have some in the skatepark's
        <a href="https://skatebuffalo.com/skateparks/lockport/">SkateBuffalo entry</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I never skated the old, wooden skatepark, so I can't say how the new one compares.
        That said, I really like the new skatepark.
        If I lived closer to it, I'd be there all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The skatepark has most of the staples. There's a ledge, a down ledge
        (is it still a hubba if it's not next to stairs?),
        3 flat rails, a hand rail, a 5-stair, banks, and lots of transition.
    </p>
    <p>
        The park also has some unique features uncommon in the area.
        This includes a miniramp with a spine, 2 hips, and slappy curbs
        that ring the inner cut-out.
    </p>
    <p>
        Railyard's most notable feature is its gap.
        The ledge, a flat rail, and a bump-to-bump span the gap.
        At one end is a roller next to transition with pool coping.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I was there, I spent most of my time using these features and the gap.
        I was able to do some ollies over the gap and 50-50s across the ledge that spans it.
        I tried to ollie the bump-to-bump, but I couldn't.
        I'd like to boardslide the rail across the gap, but I didn't even try it.
        I'd love to go back and try the bump-to-bump again.
    </p>
    <p>
        My biggest complaint is that the only flat ledge is on the small side;
        some might call it a manual pad, though it's somewhat narrow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Location-wise, it would be nice to have bathrooms nearby.
        There are bathrooms in the park, but they were locked in the middle of a spring day.
        I imagine the adjacent pool has bathrooms, but it was locked up as well.
        (Side note: I can imagine wet children running from the pool to flop around the skatepark.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Railyard's definitely one of the best skateparks in the area.
        The people of Lockport are lucky to have it.
        I hope they keep the park in good condition for many years.
