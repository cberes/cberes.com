<p>
  This is the fall 2025 installment of my skateboarding highlights.
  At the end of every season I make a short video of all the tricks I learned.

</ol>
<p>
  Out of nowhere I tried blunts to fakie and they seemed very possible.
  I made a dedicated <a href="https://youtu.be/oo25GuEWyN8?si=CunDKjLMitOFfzMn">video</a> on that topic.
  That's still the only blunt to fakie I've done at Food Court.
</p>
<p>
  Once I learned them regular, I wanted to learn them switch.
  I eventually did, but I had a rib injury while trying switch blunt nose grabs.
  I was sore for a few weeks, but luckily I think I'm fully healed.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://youtu.be/67qlyetrDG0?si=sz-Ju3A4i60767-W">Skate IQ</a> inspired me to try switch FS rocks n roll.
  And I got a few switch FS pop shove-its over an A-frame, which I'd wanted to do for almost a year.
</p>
<p>
  Nollie pop rock is a new one. I'd been trying it for awhile but couldn't get it to "pop."
  I did one in a line with a fakie pop rock, and I decided to include the whole thing.

<p>
  This <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/-EStgpbb-oA?si=98djF1Gjd9-ICf-I">Jon Bishop video of his kid skating a rail</a>
  inspired me to try boardslide to fakie, which I got pretty quickly.
  I'd done switch boardslides to regular before, but never back to switch.
  After the boardslide to fakie, a switch boardslide (back to switch) seemed like the natural next step.
  And I'd done a FS boardslide before (probably only one), but I'm feeling more comfortable with them now.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, I did a BS 50-50 on a ledge.
  These ledges are tall for me.
  I started trying them a year or two ago, but the ollie backside was frightening.
  This time around, I tried them for four days in row, about 6 hours total.
  I finally got one on the last try on day four.
  My plan is to keep practicing them so I can do them more consistently.

  Like I said, I make these videos every season.
  I've never posted them here before, but I might do so in the future.
  Here are my highlight videos from past seasons:
