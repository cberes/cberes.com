  New website: 2025 edition
date: 2025-12-14

<p>
  This website is now built using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> instead of the Perl script I wrote a couple years ago.
  Everything should look the same as before, except for some minor visual tweaks.
</p>
<p>
  Eleventy is a static site generator like <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, which I've used before.
  However Eleventy uses Javascript instead of Go.
  While it uses Javascript, it outputs ordinary HTML files instead of single-page apps like Angular or Vue.
</p>
<p>
  Last year I read <a href="https://www.learning-perl.com/"><em>Learning Perl</em></a>.
  Then I <a href="../new-website-2024-edition/">made this website</a> to practice with Perl.
  However, I've barely used Perl since then&mdash;lately I've been re-learning Python.
  The thought of using Perl to implement something like pagination didn't interest me.
  That's the biggest reason why I decided to use Eleventy, but it has other advantages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>I'm more familiar with Javascript than Go or Perl</li>
  <li>The Github pipeline to build and deploy the website takes about 30 seconds, compared to around 5 minutes with Perl</li>
  <li>I can run a live web server, which my Perl script couldn't do</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Through the process of implementing my website with Eleventy, I've gotten to use a number of its features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collections (of course)</li>
  <li>Pagination</li>
  <li>Layouts</li>
  <li>Building pages from data</li>
  <li>Plugins (RSS)</li>
  <li>Computed data</li>
  <li>Nunjucks filters</li>
  <li>Shortcodes</li>
  <li>Passthrough file copy</li>
  <li>Global data</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I'm curious about other features that I haven't used yet.
  However, I've entirely replaced my old build system, so I don't think I need any other features.
</p>
<p>
  It was a short, fun project.
  Was it necessary considering I hadn't updated my website in a year and a half?
  Time will tell!
