    <h2>New website: 2024 edition</h2>
    <p id="time">2024/02/21</p>
    <p>
      Earlier this month I finally took the plunge and blew away my old homepage in exchange for a new, sad, dopey-looking homepage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made my <a href="https://twentyfifteen.cberes.com/">old website</a> back in 2015.
      I'm still proud of it.
      I think it looks nice, especially for having been made almost a decade ago.
      While the technical side comes easy to me, the aesthetic side does not.
      I have to work hard to make something that's not offensive to the eyeballs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around 2017 I stopped working on my website, other than some small updates in 2019.
      Now, five years later, I was worried that I would no longer be able to build my website,
      due to an outdated Clojure version, obsolete dependencies, or some other problem.
      But it wasn't an issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      My primary problem with my homepage is that it looked like an advertisement for freelance work.
      However, I realized over the past few years that I have no interest in freelance work.
      I could have removed the ad-like language, but the website is complex (for me),
      and it had been so long since I worked on it, I was concerned it might take too much effort to make substantial updates.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my opinion, my old site actually looks okay on mobile devices.
      The menu bar is too small, and the content is probably too narrow&mdash;but I think it's okay for the most part.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal for my new homepage was to make something very simple.
      I want it to look as good on mobile devices as it does on desktop.
      This is nothing groundbreaking.
      But even with my old website, I accepted imperfections on mobile devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recently read <a href="https://www.learning-perl.com/">Learning Perl</a>,
      so I decided it would be a lark to use Perl to build my homepage as a static site.
    </p>
    <p>
      I considered using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.
      If you don't care about having a bespoke design, Hugo makes it easy to quickly setup a static site so you can get to work on the content.
      That's the approach I took with <a href="https://skatebuffalo.com/">Skate Buffalo</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I <em>have</em> made a custom theme for a unique appearance,
      as I did with Molly's <a href="https://github.com/mollykb/mollyillustration">portfolio site</a>.
      It was a lot of work, and it required learning much about Hugo.
      That was back in 2018, and I haven't made a custom theme since then.
      If I wanted to make another custom Hugo theme, I might have to re-learn it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead I was inspired by learning about <a href="https://impractical-labor.org/projects.html#state">ILSSA</a>
      to choose the tools that I would enjoy using the most. So for now it's Perl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new homepage still needs a lot of work. Before today, there was no stylesheet.
      I searched for "simple css" and discovered classless CSS.
      For the moment I added <a href="https://simplecss.org/">Simple.css</a>, but I might look for another stylesheet or make my own.
      Whatever I do, I want to be light on the styling, but I still want the site to look good (on mobile and desktop).
    </p>
    <p>
      And there are many little things I want to work on:
        an RSS feed,
        navigation between articles,
        pagination in the article list,
        and cleaning up the build script,
      to name a few.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, this will keep me busy for a little while.
