title: Vintage Buffalo Skate Spot Map

<p>
  I found a website from 2003 with a list of skatespots in Buffalo, New York.
  I made a map of most of the spots.

<p>
  The website is <code>https://www.angelfire.com/punk/buffaloskate/skatespots.htm</code>.
  Sadly it's now offline. I was lucky to have found it before that happened.
  However, you can find it on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190806182730/https://www.angelfire.com/punk/buffaloskate/skatespots.htm">Wayback Machine</a>.
</p>
<p>
  According to the Wayback Machine, the website was created in 2003.
  And it was hosted on Angelfire, which is a blast from the past.
  I also remember Tripod, where I created my first website as a kid.
</p>
<p>
  I imagine many of the spots are no longer skateable. However, some are!
  I've skated at Triangle Park. I know Sisti Park is still there.
  This summer I'd like to check out some of the spots.

<p>
  There were a few entries I didn't add to the map:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Broadway Banks: I don't know where on Broadway this is or was</li>
  <li>Ghetto Park: I'm not sure where this was, and according to the list it was destroyed </li>
  <li>Main St: it's a long street</li>
  <li>Urban Skateshop: I don't know where on Elmwood this was</li>
  <li>Manhattan Square in Rochester: too far for a Buffalo map</li>
  <li>SUNY Fredonia: same</li>
</ul>
